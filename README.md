# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop .

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

- In February, there was a notable decline in revenue for each store, but a rebound occurred in March, with continuous monthly growth in revenue thereafter.

- Coffee stands out as the primary revenue generator in every store, closely followed by Tea and Bakery on a month-to-month basis.

- While peak business times for each store typically range between 7 am and 10 am, the average number of transactions per guest tends to occur later in the day, specifically between 4 pm and 7 pm.

# Recommendation

- To reduce costs, it is recommended to refrain from ordering certain products, such as Packaged Chocolates, during months when they contribute less to overall revenue.

-Consider adjusting store hours by shortening them in cases where the total guest count for the month falls below 200, aiming to optimize cost-of-operation.
